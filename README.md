# Opera Season Database

This sqlite database contains operas that New York's Metropolitan Opera has performed, since I moved back to the US in 2017. At that point Patty and I started seeing at first a few, then six or seven, every season. After a few years of keeping track of this in a spreadsheet, I put it in a database.

To Dos include streching it back to 2017 (right now it's only since 2022), and refining the data. Of course, also seeing more operas, maybe beyond the Met.
